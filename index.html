        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I write Java and Python code. Sometimes an unfortunate database feels my touch as well.</p>
	<p>Currently I work for a genetic testing company helping to develop microservices and support labarortories across the United States. Based in Austin, TX but from North Carolina originally I have an interest in learning all things. A self taught programmer I like to roll my own programs/layouts/websites not cause they're prettier but because I deeply enjoy the process of understanding how the world around me works.</P>
	<span></span>
	<p>If you see something amiss or simply just want to talk please drop me a line at either maximgoodman@gmail.com or reach me through my LinkedIn below. I appreciate your taking the time to check out my website and please come back soon. It is constantly evolving as I continue to experiment with the mysterious world of user interfaces</p>
